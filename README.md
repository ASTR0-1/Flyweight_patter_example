‚ô¶Ô∏è<b>Flyweight_pattern_example</b>

<i>This is the example of Structural pattern Flyweight. Made for Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.</i>

üéØThe task is:

<i>
<pre>
  Implement wheeled robots with body-mounted devices, where the devices can be different robots.
    Each cash register has a maximum unique number, a collection of goods and the possibility of adding goods,
    save and print the receipt.
</pre>
</i>

‚ÑπÔ∏è<b>Some info about that pattern:</b>

<i>
The Flyweight Design Pattern is used when there is a need to create a large number of objects of almost similar nature. 
A large number of objects consumes a large amount of memory and the Flyweight design pattern provides a solution for reducing the load on memory by sharing objects.

This design pattern is basically used to reduce the number of objects created, decrease the memory footprint, and increase the overall performance of the application. 
That means this design pattern tries to reduce the already existing similar kind of objects by storing them and create a new object when no matching object is found. 
If this is not clear at the moment then don‚Äôt worry, we will try to understand this with an example.
